		Why Are We doing This Project ?
		<p> In the world, there are many people that don't have the money to afford a well balanced, healthy meal. They don't get the nutriets they need and lack essential vitamins. They can't afford healthier food like fish, meat, vegetables, fruit... Due to this they go to places that are not expensive where the price and the quality of the food is very low. These places include McDonald's, KFC, Dunkin Donuts, Baskin Robbin and many more. These people are unaware of the toll that all this fast food takes on their health and bodies. Our organization helps provide lower class citizens and families with healthy foood options and educate them on the dangers that come with eating unhealthy food (like diabetes, heart attacks, heart diseases, and obessity).</p>
